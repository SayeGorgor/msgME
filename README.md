# msgME Messenger App

This is a responsive full stack messenger web app that allows users to message their friends in real-time. To start you can create an account and then log in using your credentials or log in using your Github or Instagram (If you are creating an account manually you will need to accept the verification email before logging in). Afterwards you will be taken to the home screen. Once on the home screen you can either go to "Manage Account" to add a profile picture or you can go to the "Add Friends" tab to search for users to befriend. Once you've made a friend you can begin messaging with them!
